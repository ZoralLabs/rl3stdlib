# RL3 Standard Library
The RL3 Standard Library is a collection of modules accessible to a RL3 program to simplify the programming process and removing the need to rewrite commonly used RL3 patterns and predicates. It is part of [RL3 Information Extraction, NER & NLP Engine](https://rl3.zorallabs.com/wiki/Main_Page).
